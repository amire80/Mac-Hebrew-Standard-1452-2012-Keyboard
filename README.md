# Mac-Hebrew-Standard-1452-2012-Keyboard
An implementation of the standard Hebrew keyboard for Mac OSX.

This implements a Hebrew keyboard for Mac OSX according to the 2012 version of the SI 1452 standard, the same one on which the default Hebrew keyboard in Microsoft Windows 8 and desktop GNU/Linux distributions are based.

This keyboard layout was made with Ukelele. I thank SIL for making Ukelele available.

To install, copy the bundle file to ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts. After that add the keyboard in the keyboard preferences window.

Use the Alt/Option key to type niqqud and characters such as LRM, ₪ and ־.

I hereby call upon Appleto adopt this as the default Hebrew keyboard in future releases of Mac OSX.

This software is released under the CC0 1.0 Universal license.
