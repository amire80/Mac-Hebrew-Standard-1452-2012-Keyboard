# Mac-Hebrew-Standard-1452-2012-Keyboard
An implementation of the standard Hebrew keyboard for Mac OSX.

This implements a Hebrew keyboard for Mac OSX according to the 2012 version of the SI 1452 standard, the same one on which the default Hebrew keyboard in Microsoft Windows 8 and desktop GNU/Linux distributions are based.

This keyboard layout was made with Ukelele. I thank SIL for making Ukelele available.

To install, copy the bundle file to ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts. After that add the keyboard in the keyboard preferences window.

Use the Alt/Option key to type niqqud and characters such as LRM, ₪ and ־.

If you find any deviations from the standard, mistakes in the documentation or any other bugs, please send patches or create issues.

I hereby call upon Apple, Inc. to adopt this as the default Hebrew keyboard in future releases of Mac OSX. That's supposed to be the point of standards :)
